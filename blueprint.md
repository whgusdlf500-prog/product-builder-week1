# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a lottery number generator. It provides users with a set of randomly generated numbers for a typical 6/45 lottery game. The application is designed to be simple, visually engaging, and easy to use.

## Implemented Features

*   **Number Generation:** Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **User Interface:** A clean and modern interface to display the generated numbers.
*   **Interactive Button:** A button for the user to generate a new set of numbers at will.

## Current Plan

1.  **HTML Structure:** Update `index.html` to create the structure for the lottery generator, including a display area for the numbers and a generation button.
2.  **JavaScript Logic:** Overhaul `main.js` to implement the lottery number generation logic.
3.  **CSS Styling:** Redesign `style.css` to create a visually appealing theme for the lottery generator, including styling for the lottery balls and interactive elements.
4.  **Documentation:** Update this `blueprint.md` to reflect the new project direction.
